# MCP_Security

MCP_Security is a public repository designed for experimenting with the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for cybersecurity. This project serves as an experiment for exploring how MCP can be leveraged to create MCP servers for cybersecurity.

----------

## What is MCP?
The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a flexible and extensible protocol that enables seamless communication between Large Language Models (LLMs) and external tools, data sources, or systems. It provides a standardized framework for integrating resources and tools into applications powered by LLMs, allowing for dynamic and context-aware interactions.

### Key features of MCP:

- Resource Handling: Define and manage data resources that LLMs can query.
- Tool Integration: Enable LLMs to execute specific actions via tool handlers.
- Client-Server Architecture: Facilitates structured communication between LLMs (clients) and external systems (servers).
- Extensibility: Supports various transport mechanisms, including stdio and SSE, for diverse use cases.
